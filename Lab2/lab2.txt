Lab2 - Add rules to ping from VM to VM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep the terminal connection to VM1 open (if lab1 was completed - if not then
open one based on the instructions in lab1.txt) and in a new terminal connect
to VM2.  This can be done in the same way as you connected to VM1 in lab1.txt 
(VM2 has the 192.x.x.x IP address corresponding to the mac finishing in 02).
There should now be three terminals in view, one directly connected to the OVS
machine and one connected to both VM1 and VM2.

1. Assign IP addresses to the VF netdevs on the VMs. In the VM1 terminal run the following: 

ifconfig eth1 10.0.0.1

and in VM2:

ifconfig eth1 10.0.0.2

2.  Delete the previous rules from the switch and add new rules as follows:

ovs-ofctl del-flows br0

ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "icmp,nw_dst=10.0.0.1,action=2"

ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "icmp,nw_dst=10.0.0.2,action=3"

ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "arp,action=NORMAL"

These rules match ICMP traffic and direct the packets to a specified port based
on their destination IP address. The final rule handles ARP traffic by giving
it the NORMAL action. This basically forwards ARP packets to all ports with the
exception of the port it arrived on (the same way that a simple L2 learning
switch may do).

3. In the main server terminal window run the following command:

watch -n 0.1 ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0

This adds a watch on the flow rules so traffic can be seen matching the rules
as it passes through.

With the watch command still running, go to VM1 and ping VM2 using its IP
address. For example:

root@vm1:~# ping 10.0.0.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.818 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.353 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.342 ms
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pings should complete showing the connectivity between the VMs. The watch
command should show the new ICMP rules incrementing as the ping request and
response messages are matched against these rules and forwarded to the correct
VM. Feel free to try pinging VM1 from VM2.
